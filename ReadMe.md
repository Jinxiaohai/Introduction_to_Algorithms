*All stuff contained is user-implemented algorithms depicted in the book Introduction to Algorithms, and most of which can be considered as candidates for solutions to exercises*

*For any other solutions to exercise, please see at http://sdrv.ms/17TUmTY*

+ `PermutingBySorting.`
randomize an array via generating and sorting priorities associating with elements in the array.
        
+ `PermuteInPlace.`
randomize an array in place.
        
+ `RandomSample.`
produce a m-subset from S={1,2,3,..,n}.
